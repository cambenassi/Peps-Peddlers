    This is only a proof of concept for the format of the website based on the PDF that was given to me. If you have any specific <br>
    changes or any additions that you would like to add, feel free to let me know. Once the structure of the website is agreed upon,<br>
    I can start making it work on any sized screen, as well as making the rest of the website look better/more modern.

    Improvements to be Made When Website Design is Approved
    <ul>
        <li>"Featured Photos" section will feature a photo carousel (Google Bootstrap Carousel for an example)</li>
        <li>First text box (1 goal: to end MS) can feature a graphic, just have to create it/fit it with the rest of the website)</li>
        <li>Left Sidebar will be filled with other elements to appear less empty</li>
        <li>Website will be made to dynamically fit to any sized screen</li>
        <li>Links on side will work & will go to other similarly styled pages</li>
        <li>Logos at bottom currently only link to facebook group, but can add other social media/other important links & information</li>
        <li>General Appearence Improvements</li>
    </ul>
